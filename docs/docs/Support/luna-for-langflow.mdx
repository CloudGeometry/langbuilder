With **Luna for LangBuilder** support, you can develop and deploy LangBuilder applications with confidence.

Luna is a subscription to the LangBuilder expertise at DataStax. It's meant for LangBuilder users who want all the benefits of running their own open-source deployments, as well as the peace of mind that comes with having direct access to the team that has authored the majority of the LangBuilder code.

Luna subscribers can get help with general-purpose and technical questions for their open-source LangBuilder deployments.
If an issue is encountered, DataStax is there to help.
