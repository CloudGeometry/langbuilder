## Problem Being Solved

### The AI Implementation Gap

Despite the proliferation of powerful AI models and frameworks, organizations face significant challenges in turning AI capabilities into practical business solutions:

**1. High Development Overhead**
- Building AI workflows requires substantial boilerplate code
- Integration with LLMs, vector stores, and business tools is complex
- Testing and iteration cycles are slow

**2. Vendor Lock-In Risk**
- Committing to a single LLM provider limits flexibility
- Switching providers requires significant code changes
- Cost optimization across providers is difficult

**3. Enterprise Integration Complexity**
- Connecting AI to existing business systems (CRM, ERP, etc.) requires custom development
- Each integration adds maintenance burden
- Security and compliance requirements complicate implementation

**4. Knowledge Silos**
- AI implementations are often "black boxes" to non-technical stakeholders
- Collaboration between technical and business teams is hindered
- Documentation and knowledge transfer are challenging
